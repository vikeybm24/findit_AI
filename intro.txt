1. Project Description
Project Title: AI-Powered Lost & Found Platform

Problem Statement: On large campuses, in offices, or at public events, a significant number of personal items are lost daily. Existing lost and found systems are inefficient, often relying on manual processes and physical collection points, which leads to a low rate of item recovery and a frustrating experience for users.

Solution: This project proposes the development of an AI-Powered Lost & Found Platform. The system will use a web application to streamline the process of reporting and retrieving lost items by leveraging AI for intelligent item matching. By combining visual and text-based search, the platform will connect users in real-time and significantly increase the chances of an item being returned to its rightful owner.

Project Goals:

To create a secure and user-friendly platform for reporting lost and found items.

To implement an AI-driven matching system that uses image recognition and natural language processing (NLP) to find potential matches.

To provide a secure communication channel for users to coordinate the return of items.

To demonstrate a scalable and efficient solution that can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as universities, airports, or large event venues.

2. User Flow
The user flow is designed to be intuitive and direct, guiding users through the core functionalities of reporting, matching, and returning an item.

User Roles
Lost User: A person who has lost an item.

Found User: A person who has found an item.

Admin: A user with special permissions to manage and moderate the system.

Core User Flow
User Authentication:

Sign Up: New user provides a username, email, and password. The system creates a secure account.

Login: Existing user logs in to access their personal dashboard and system features.

Report an Item:

Report Lost: A "Lost User" navigates to the "Report Lost Item" page. They upload a photo of the item (or a similar item), provide a detailed text description, and specify the last known location. The system saves the report in the database.

Report Found: A "Found User" navigates to the "Report Found Item" page. They upload a photo of the found item and provide a brief description. The system uses AI to analyze the image and text.

AI Matching Process:

Upon a new item submission (either lost or found), the system's AI component triggers a similarity search.

The system compares the new item's image and text embeddings against all existing reports in the database.

If the similarity score exceeds a predefined threshold, the system flags it as a potential match.

Notification and Claim:

Lost User Notification: The "Lost User" receives an email and an in-app notification: "A potential match has been found for your lost [item name]!"

Claim Item: The "Lost User" can view the matched item and its description. They click a "Claim" button, which sends a claim request to the "Found User."

Secure Communication & Return:

Chat Request: Once the claim is accepted, a secure, in-app chat is initiated between the two users.

Item Verification: The users can use the chat to arrange a meeting and verify the item (e.g., "What was the wallpaper on your phone?").

Item Return: Once the item is successfully returned, either user can mark the report as "Resolved" in the system.

3. Project Technology and Requirements
Frontend (Client-Side):

React.js: A robust and modern JavaScript library for building a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) with a great user experience.

HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.

JavaScript: For interactivity and API communication.

Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from React to the Django backend.

React Router: For handling navigation and routing between different pages in the application.

Backend (Server-Side):

Django: A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and scalable APIs.

Django REST Framework (DRF): A powerful toolkit for building the RESTful API endpoints for the React front end.

Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (for a simple MVP). PostgreSQL is recommended for a scalable solution.

Authentication: djangorestframework-simplejwt for implementing secure, token-based user authentication.

AI & Machine Learning:

Image Processing: Use a pre-trained deep learning model like ResNet or MobileNetV2 to generate image embeddings.

NLP: Use a pre-trained model like Sentence-Transformers or OpenAI's text embeddings to convert text descriptions into vectors.

Vector Database: For the MVP, a simple in-memory search is sufficient. For a scalable version, a vector database like Pinecone or FAISS is used to store and quickly search high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) to find matches.

Communication & Infrastructure:

Real-time Chat: Firebase Realtime Database or a similar service to handle the secure, real-time messaging between users.

Email Service: SendGrid or Mailgun for sending automated notifications (e.g., new match found, claim request received).
